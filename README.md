# Richmond Bank Total Core Deposit Forecasts
Using MS Excel and R, accurately forecasted total core deposit data from a Richmond Bank. The Holt’s Linear Exponential Smoothing had the overall lowest “Quick and Dirty” MAPE (1.2%), the lowest overall Maximum MAPE (3.49%), and consistently more accurate projections for each of the forecast horizons. Overall, the Unaided, Holts Linear Exponential Smoothing, and both regressions overestimated while the Naïve, 12 Month (M) Center Moving Average (CMA), 3M Moving Average (MA), 6M MA, Damped Trend Exponential Smoothing, and Simple Exponential Smoothing underestimated.
